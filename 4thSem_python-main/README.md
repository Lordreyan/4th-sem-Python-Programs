## Usage & dependencies.
# Dependencies

In Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with Python, several modules and libraries are commonly used to implement various data structures and algorithms. Here are some popular ones:

## NumPy

NumPy is a powerful library for numerical operations in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these elements.

*Installation:* `pip install numpy`

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is often used for plotting graphs and charts in the context of algorithm analysis.

*Installation:* `pip install matplotlib`

## Pandas

Pandas is a data manipulation and analysis library. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrame, which are useful for handling and analyzing structured data in algorithms.

*Installation:* `pip install pandas`

## NetworkX

NetworkX is a library for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks (graphs).

*Installation:* `pip install networkx`

## SymPy

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It can be used in algorithms that involve symbolic computation, such as those related to algebraic structures.

*Installation:* `pip install sympy`

## SciPy

SciPy is a library used for scientific and technical computing. It builds on NumPy and provides additional functionality for optimization, signal and image processing, statistical functions, etc.

*Installation:* `pip install scipy`

## Algorithm Visualization Tools (e.g., PyGraphviz, Graph-tool)

Depending on the nature of your algorithms, you might use visualization tools to represent data structures and algorithm flow. PyGraphviz and Graph-tool are examples.

*Installation:* `pip install pygraphviz` or `pip install graph-tool`
